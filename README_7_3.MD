В первую очередь, в дополнение к существующему ресурсу, создадим *ресурсы* для *aws_dynamodb_table* и *aws_s3_bucket*:

```
[~/Documents/education/terraform_netology]$ terraform apply                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              *[main]
aws_dynamodb_table.terraform_state_lock: Refreshing state... [id=app-state]
aws_instance.my_aws_ubuntu: Refreshing state... [id=i-08037b17ad6962ef1]

Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # aws_s3_bucket.my_terraform_state will be created
  + resource "aws_s3_bucket" "my_terraform_state" {
      + acceleration_status         = (known after apply)
      + acl                         = "private"
      + arn                         = (known after apply)
      + bucket                      = "vinnirus1tfstate"
      + bucket_domain_name          = (known after apply)
      + bucket_regional_domain_name = (known after apply)
      + force_destroy               = false
      + hosted_zone_id              = (known after apply)
      + id                          = (known after apply)
      + region                      = (known after apply)
      + request_payer               = (known after apply)
      + tags_all                    = (known after apply)
      + website_domain              = (known after apply)
      + website_endpoint            = (known after apply)

      + versioning {
          + enabled    = true
          + mfa_delete = false
        }
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.

Do you want to perform these actions?
  Terraform will perform the actions described above.
  Only 'yes' will be accepted to approve.

  Enter a value: yes

aws_s3_bucket.my_terraform_state: Creating...
aws_s3_bucket.my_terraform_state: Still creating... [10s elapsed]
aws_s3_bucket.my_terraform_state: Still creating... [20s elapsed]
aws_s3_bucket.my_terraform_state: Creation complete after 20s [id=vinnirus1tfstate]

Apply complete! Resources: 1 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:

instance_account_id = "094316163368"
instance_network = "subnet-014f920c4641b1a15"
instance_private_ip_addr = "172.31.31.27"
instance_region = "us-west-2"
instance_user_id = "094316163368"
```
Затем зарегистрируем *backend* в *terraform* для применения настройки хранения *state* в *dynamodb*:

```
[~/Documents/education/terraform_netology]$ terraform init -reconfigure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  *[main]

Initializing the backend...
Do you want to copy existing state to the new backend?
  Pre-existing state was found while migrating the previous "local" backend to the
  newly configured "s3" backend. No existing state was found in the newly
  configured "s3" backend. Do you want to copy this state to the new "s3"
  backend? Enter "yes" to copy and "no" to start with an empty state.

  Enter a value: yes


Successfully configured the backend "s3"! Terraform will automatically
use this backend unless the backend configuration changes.

Initializing provider plugins...
- Reusing previous version of hashicorp/aws from the dependency lock file
- Using previously-installed hashicorp/aws v3.63.0

Terraform has been successfully initialized!

You may now begin working with Terraform. Try running "terraform plan" to see
any changes that are required for your infrastructure. All Terraform commands
should now work.

If you ever set or change modules or backend configuration for Terraform,
rerun this command to reinitialize your working directory. If you forget, other
commands will detect it and remind you to do so if necessary.

Инициализация *terraform* выполнена в предыдущем пункте; </br>
Далее создаем требуемые *workspace*:</br>

```
[~/Documents/education/terraform_netology]$ terraform workspace new stage                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                *[main]
Created and switched to workspace "stage"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.
[~/Documents/education/terraform_netology]$ terraform workspace new prod                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 *[main]
Created and switched to workspace "prod"!

You're now on a new, empty workspace. Workspaces isolate their state,
so if you run "terraform plan" Terraform will not see any existing state
for this configuration.

```
Вывод команды ```terraform workspace list```

```
[~/Documents/education/terraform_netology]$ terraform workspace list                                                                                           *[main]

```

Вывод команды ```terraform plan```
